## 🚀 What I Do

I design and build systems where:

- AI models evolve over time (dynamic learning systems)
- Backend architectures scale reliably
- Multi-agent systems collaborate intelligently
- Infrastructure supports real-world institutional environments

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Distributed Systems
- Backend Engineering
- Digital Transformation

## 🧠 Research & Experimental Work

### CLE-Net — Continuous Learning Embedding Network
A dynamic graph learning model designed for temporal knowledge evolution.

- Continuous embedding updates for evolving networks
- Adaptive learning mechanisms for temporal graphs
- Benchmark-oriented architecture (DynamicTriad, VGRNN comparisons in progress)
- Designed for reproducible experimentation
